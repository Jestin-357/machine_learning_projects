The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, 
our machine learning model must predict the house price.
To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learn’s boston dataset.

In this dataset, each row describes a boston town or suburb. There are 506 rows and 13 attributes (features) with a 
target column (price)
